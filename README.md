# Naive Bayes
A machine learning classification algorithm implementing Naive Bayes.

# Implemented features
- Bigrams & Stopwords. To gain more meaningful tokenized data.
- Cross Validation 10-fold. To help stablize bias and decrease variance.
- Laplace smoothing. To avoid zero probabilities.
- Confusion Maxtrix. To calculate models accuracy, precision, recall & F1.
